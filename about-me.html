    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Humaira Barekzai (professional athleth)<hr></h1>
    <p>I am Humaira Barekzai(professional athleth), born in Kabul Afghanistan. 
        I was the captain of the Women's National Handball team of Afghanistan.
        Since 2015, I have proudly represented my country in many national and international grounds.
        I have also took part in many national and international conference to fight for the women rights. specially,
        helping and motivating women to participate in sports. I was also actively part of the media reperesenting Afghanistan's women voice in the sports field.
        I have studied sport education in kabul educational (Prof. Rabanni) university.
        I am currently living in Berlin, Germany.<br>
        After sports, I have a great interest in computer science and plan to study it in the future.
        I enjoy :
        <ul>
            <li>swimming</li>
            <li>cycling</li> 
            <li>reading books</li>
            <li>writing poetry</li>
        </ul><br>
        I can speak different langugages such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>Dari</li>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>German</li>
            <li>Urdu</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        After coming to germany I did not felt the same feeling while playing handball. because i was not able to represent my country under my national flag.
        Moreover, due to multiple shoulder injuries i was adviced by the doctors to give some rest to my shoulder and not take part in heavy sports for some time.
        Therefore, I have diverted my plans to first integrate into the germany society by learning german language. Furthermore, I had the interest towards <b>IT</b>. because the world is moving so fast.
        and technology is playing cruical role in many aspects of our life. Therefore, I am keen to lean programming and advance my knowlege in this field and grow into the career of <strong>web desinger and developer</strong>.
